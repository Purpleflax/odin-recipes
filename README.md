# odin-recipes
Quick note prior to starting the project.

I will be making an entirely HTML based website listing food recipes. No CSS styling will be involved yet so it will be barebones style-wise but functional. I have a fair idea of the basics of HTML from prior use but I hope to become more affulent with it. Mainly I hope to get better at the Git workflow and working from the command line. It would be a good bonus to learn some file structing for web design too.
